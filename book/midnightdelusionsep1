	I wanna float
	I want to just be able to lay on my back in the middle of the ocean and just
	Exist
	For a little while
	I wanna take everything in, the sound, sights, smells
	And live for once in my life

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:20 PM
	I feel that too right now
	I think we all need a break to just... float around with not a care in the world

abbster — Yesterday at 11:20 PM
	Do you wanna float together?

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:21 PM
	yis
	ooh council road trip to the beach? (edited)

abbster — Yesterday at 11:21 PM
	We may be able to listen to the dolphins and take in the nice ocean breeze
	Exist for the purpose of living instead of fulfilling all these meaningless responsibilities
	Why aren't we allowed to live?
	To just be at peace
	Not a fear or worry or anything that would put us under stress
	I wanna float so I can experience the world by living just to live
	Even if only for an hour or two
	Why can't we just be
	Maybe that's why heavens so appealing
	No responsibility, no pain, no fear
	Nothing to worry about

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:25 PM
	I think you're absolutely right abbs
	I think all of us yearn for our responsibilities and burdens to leave us for a while...
	to quote Everclear, "we can live beside the ocean, and leave the fire behind. Swim out past the breakers, and watch the world die"

	I don't want to live my life trying to find a purpose or have a job that's just a means to an end
	@Aspectious to quote Everclear, "we can live beside the ocean, and leave the fire behind. Swim out past the breakers, and watch the world die"
	I would like that I think
	I want to live Griffin
	I'm tired of having to be another gear in the great engine that our work has become
	I want to be the most me I can be
	But I feel trapped
	Because this world doesn't like those who wish to escape the Rat Race

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:28 PM
	aint that the truth

abbster — Yesterday at 11:29 PM
	So I don't think I will ever be able to just float
	To lay in a meadow and breath in the spring flowers
	To sit at the top of a tree and view the world just for the sake of looking
	To walk aimlessly because I wouldn't need to be anywhere or do anything

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:30 PM
	its ironic
	growing up gives you lots of freedoms on what you can do, yet restricts you from actually living freely (edited)

abbster — Yesterday at 11:31 PM
	I wanna float Griffin
	I've never been able to
	Not even when I was a kid
	There were to many expectations and responsibilities for me to do that
	And its only tripled since
	I wanna cry in a corner
	I wanna sleep for a few years and then return back just as it was when I went to sleep
	I want to float where the pain of today and the dreadful anticipation of tomorrow can't reach me anymore
	I know I've said it already but I just want to be for once

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:34 PM
	Abby

abbster — Yesterday at 11:34 PM
	Yeah?

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:34 PM
	I am going to say something I do not normally say
	Abby, you need to go to North Carolina

abbster — Yesterday at 11:35 PM
	Why?

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:35 PM
	You need to take a long vacation at the outer banks, where you can just chill and relax for a good chunk of time
	to rest, swim out past the breakers, and watch the world die for a while

abbster — Yesterday at 11:35 PM
	I can't, Griffin
	It would cost me too much to do it
	I would lose too many people

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:36 PM
	Then it is a goal to work towards, an achievable heaven

abbster
	I would lose too many people

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:36 PM
	elaborate?

abbster — Yesterday at 11:37 PM
	If I went I would have to go alone
	But it's no fun watching the world die alone
	My parents would get angry at me, accusing me of abandoning them
	I would probably lose one or more of you guys due to lack of contact
	And I don't think I can take that

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
	Then we are coming with you

abbster — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
	That would be nice

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
	cause I think we all could use a damn break tbh
	We can rent a beachside house at the outer banks for like 6 people for fairly cheap for a week or two
	a good chunk of the council
	and relax on a vacation, all of us able to relax and watch the world die

abbster — Yesterday at 11:39 PM
	That sounds nice
	I think it's time I go to bed Griffin
	Goodnight
	And, for all it's worth, I hope one day we'll both be able to just float for a little while

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
	I hope so too

abbster — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
	Goodnight, Griffin

Aspectious — Yesterday at 11:40 PM
	goodnight
